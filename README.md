<h1>Demos</h1>
It contains some Three.js demos that I've worked on. More will be in the future.
<div style="margin-left: 50px;
                background-color: orange;">
       <h2>Earth</h2>
              <img   style = "height:200px; width: 200px;border: solid 2px; border-radius: 50px;" 
              src="earthGif.gif" />
              <p>
              This scene has directional light from right and ambiant light, and star background.<br>
              The earth object uses Phong shading, texture mapping, specular mapping, and normal mapping for realistic looking.<br>
              Moreover, I deployed functions that can virtualize and 3D the saved data. In this case, I use population according to geographical location <br>
              and dynamically creating rectangular pillars which map onto the sphere object.

       <h2>Controllable Cube</h2>
              <img   style = "height:200px; width: 200px;border: solid 2px; border-radius: 50px;" 
              src="controllableCube.gif" />
              <p>
              This is a controllable cube, controlled through keyboard: up, down, left, right.
              </p>
       <h2>Maze</h2>
              <img   style = "height:200px; width: 200px;border: solid 2px; border-radius: 50px;" 
              src="maze.gif" />
              <p>
              Utilizing controllable cube, I was able to create a maze game. The maze spawned randomly which means many possibilities.<br>
              The challenging is to implement collision detection such that every time cube hit a wall it will go back to start.
              </p>
       <h2>AR Text</h2>
              <img   style = "height:200px; width: 200px;border: solid 2px; border-radius: 50px;" 
              src="artext.gif" />
              <p>
              This is an attempt to create realistic AR view on webpage, and the result is in the gif.
